  default_prompt: "Use $tinyworlds-train-to-inference to run ZELDA closed-loop training and inference with long-run safe-start parameters, stage batch floors (video=8, latent=8, dynamics=4), absolute-step checkpoint resume, dual-GPU process guard, git evidence audit, W&B/local analysis, and runtime retune ladders until inference gate criteria are met."
